## 🗿 Start Working

### [🐲 MONOREPO](https://github.com/raptormap/raptormap)

steps to start working on raptormap:
- create a fork of the above repository
- clone the newly created fork on your computer
- make some changes and push them **on your fork**
- create a pull request into the raptormap repository from your fork working branch
- wait for the tests to complete and **someone else** to review your code

### Documentation

You will find the documentation in the [docs folder](https://github.com/raptormap/raptormap/tree/main/docs) of the monorepo.\
It is written in markdown but we recommend using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to make things easier.

To use obsidian simply install it and when prompted use `Open folder as vault` and select the `docs` folder from the repository. (Do not open the whole repository in obsidian...)

Alternatively you can use the preview feature of VSCode with `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V`
